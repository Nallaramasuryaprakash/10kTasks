            <p><mark>10000 coders</mark> is a new kind of school aimed to teach people to get into high paying software jobs. We have a <q>7-month immersive program</q> that goes through a structured curriculum prepared to match the latest hiring needs.
               Our focus is on taking an unskilled person and make him a skilled learner to a high valued engineer. The goal of our program is to accelerate students into a professional career by learning to build applications at a professional level - which provides the foundation needed to build production-ready applications and demonstrate the skills to add real value to a potential employer.
               Our incentives are aligned with the success of our students. If our program doesn't help the student in getting a well-paid job within 2 months of course completion, then we consider it as our failure and refund the full fees to the student. We want focused students with grit and determination to enter our program without worrying about the economic impact if they fail to get a job. Thus we are, literally, risk-free education providers.</p>
